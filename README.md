A Responsive page Using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Descripition
As a person who is intrested in space research, I came up with a space website called "Deep Space", which is a mission based company. This webpage contains a short descripition of the company, the domains of the company, contact section , footer containg a news letter of the comapny. I used javascript to add the interactivity such as change of the color of the menu buttons and the social links in footer when they are hovered over.
